<h1 style="color:rgb(225, 127, 21);" >Private Limited Company</h1>
<p style="color:rgb(58, 58, 63);font-size:30px;">The private limited legal structure is most commonly used for the incorporation of a company. It is preferred because this structure keeps the liability of the members limited to their share in the capital. A private limited company is ideal for anyone who is looking to raise capital from external sources and/or give ESOPs to employees.

    A private limited company has to be registered with the Registrar of Companies (ROC). Upon completion of the registration process, a Certificate of Incorporation (COI) is issued. The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) has introduced a fast-track registration process that enables company registration via a single form. The registration process is done online and all documents are required to be submitted in electronic format.
    
    Registering for a private limited company means the company becomes regulatory-compliant. This makes the company attractive to venture capitalists and private equity funds. Even bank loans are easier to get for private limited companies. From the perspective of the directors in a private limited company, their personal property would not be used to repay the companyâ€™s debt.
