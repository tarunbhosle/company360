<h1 style="color:rgb(225, 127, 21);" >Limited Liability Partnership</h1>
<p style="color:rgb(58, 58, 63);font-size:30px;">Anyone running a business with partners can go for the LLP registration. An LLP works best for startups and small businesses that are run by partners and want to have the nominal regulatory compliance.

    A limited liability partnership allows the partners to be protected from any negative issues that arise because of the other partners. An LLP limits the liability of the partners to as much is their contribution to the company. An LLP incorporation is also cheaper and easier to get.
    
    An LLP is usually a smart choice for freelancers who wish to give their bootstrapping business a proper company structure from a legal perspective. An LLP will work as long as the partners donâ€™t require external funding and when they do, the LLP can be quickly turned into a private limited company..</p>
