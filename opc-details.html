Any entrepreneur who wants to form the company with limited liability should register for OPC. An OPC can be registered with a minimum capital of just Rs 1 lakh. But if the paid-up capital exceeds Rs 50 lakh, then the OPC has to be converted to a private limited company. The same holds true when the OPCâ€™s average turnover for 3 consecutive years exceeds Rs 2 crore. As is the case with registering a private limited company, OPC registration has also been made an online process by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. If OPC fits your needs best, get the registration process started..</p>
